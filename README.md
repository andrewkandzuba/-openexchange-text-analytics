# openexchange-text-analytics

Small project to play with Apache OpenNLP

During my MBA Digital Analytics study I went over the requirement to analyze sentiments of twits. 

This application started as a simple Spring Boot Web Service that accepts a text as an input and 
returns the sentiment's score.
